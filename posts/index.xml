      <description>Redis streams, added in version 5, provide a very powerful yet simple tool. One application of them is to propagate changes instantly from producer to consumer(s).
In my organisation, many of our Sources of Truth are legacy SQL databases, which we have little control over. We need to consume changes in a range of downstream systems, and the pre-existing solution was to establish point-to-point services which would poll the databases, and write the changed records into another database.</description>
